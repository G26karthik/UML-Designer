## 1. Introduction

UML Designer AI is an open-source, full-stack platform designed to automate the generation, analysis, and visualization of Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams from source code or natural language prompts. The project addresses the real-world need for rapid, accurate software architecture visualization, bridging communication gaps between technical and non-technical stakeholders.  
The motivation stems from the complexity of modern software systems and the necessity for clear documentation and design communication. The system enables users—developers, students, analysts—to convert codebases or requirements into professional UML diagrams, supporting collaboration and understanding.  
**Learning objectives** include mastering full-stack development, API design, code analysis, and the application of software engineering principles such as modularity, security, and testing.  
**Technologies used:** Node.js (Express.js), Python (Flask), React (Next.js), Tailwind CSS, PlantUML, and AI/LLM integration for enhanced code analysis.

## 2. System Design

### System Architecture

UML Designer AI follows a modular, client-server architecture:

- **Frontend:** React-based web application for user interaction, diagram rendering, and export.
- **Backend:** Node.js Express API gateway, handling requests, caching, security, and proxying to the parser.
- **Python Parser Microservice:** Analyzes code repositories, infers relationships, and generates normalized schema for UML diagrams.

The flow of control is as follows:  
User → Frontend → Backend → Python Parser → Backend → Frontend → User

### Modules

- **Frontend:**  
  - User interface for input (code or prompt), diagram visualization, and export.
  - Components: `HomePage`, `PlantUMLDiagram`, `GlobalErrorBoundary`.
- **Backend:**  
  - API routing (`api.js`), caching (memory/disk), security (CORS, validation), logging, monitoring.
  - Endpoints: `/analyze` (POST for code/prompt analysis).
- **Python Parser:**  
  - Language-specific analyzers (Python, Java, C#, etc.), relationship detection, AI enhancement, schema normalization.
  - Modules: `analyze.py`, `analyzers/`, `relationship/`, `plantuml/`.

### Backend Design

- **Database/Storage:**  
  - No traditional database; uses disk-based cache for analysis results.
  - Caching strategy: LRU in-memory and persistent disk cache keyed by repository URL and commit hash.

### Diagrams (Conceptual Role)

- **Class Diagram:** Shows main system classes and their relationships ([View Online](https://github.com/<your-org>/UML-Designer/raw/main/diagrams/class_diagram.puml)).
- **Use Case Diagram:** Illustrates user actions and system features ([View Online](https://github.com/<your-org>/UML-Designer/raw/main/diagrams/usecase_diagram.puml)).
- **Activity Diagram:** Depicts workflow from repository selection to diagram generation and export ([View Online](https://github.com/<your-org>/UML-Designer/raw/main/diagrams/activity_diagram.puml)).
- **State Diagram:** Represents system states ([View Online](https://github.com/<your-org>/UML-Designer/raw/main/diagrams/state_diagram.puml)).
- **Sequence Diagram:** Details request flow ([View Online](https://github.com/<your-org>/UML-Designer/raw/main/diagrams/sequence_diagram.puml)).
- **Component Diagram:** Outlines major modules and their connections ([View Online](https://github.com/<your-org>/UML-Designer/raw/main/diagrams/component_diagram.puml)).
- **Communication Diagram:** Shows message passing ([View Online](https://github.com/<your-org>/UML-Designer/raw/main/diagrams/communication_diagram.puml)).

*Diagrams are referenced from the project’s `/diagrams` folder and README visual overview. After pushing to GitHub, these links will allow online viewing of the diagrams.*

## 3. Implementation

### Module Integration

- **Frontend:**  
  - Built with Next.js and React, using Tailwind CSS for styling.
  - `PlantUMLDiagram.js` renders diagrams using PlantUML server, handles errors, and supports SVG/PNG export.
- **Backend:**  
  - Express.js routes requests, applies rate limiting, validates input, and manages cache.
  - Security features include CORS, request size limits, and input sanitization.
  - Logging and monitoring via Winston and custom metrics.
- **Python Parser:**  
  - Uses AST parsing for Python, `javalang` for Java, regex for other languages.
  - Relationship detection via `RelationshipDetector`.
  - AI enhancement (optional) using Groq/OpenAI-compatible API.

### Key Code Snippets

**1. Python File Analysis (PythonAnalyzer):**
```python
def analyze_file(self, file_path: str, package_path: str = "") -> List[Dict]:
    classes = []
    with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8', errors='ignore') as f:
        source = f.read()
    tree = ast.parse(source)
    self._extract_imports(tree)
    for node in ast.walk(tree):
        if isinstance(node, ast.ClassDef):
            class_dict = self._analyze_class(node, package_path)
            if class_dict:
                classes.append(class_dict)
                self.add_class_name(class_dict['class'])
    return classes
```
*Extracts classes, fields, and methods from Python files using AST.*

**2. Java File Analysis (JavaAnalyzer):**
```python
def analyze_file(self, file_path: str, package_path: str = "") -> List[Dict]:
    classes = []
    with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8', errors='ignore') as f:
        source = f.read()
    tree = javalang.parse.parse(source)
    for path_nodes, cls in tree.filter(javalang.tree.ClassDeclaration):
        class_dict = self._analyze_class(cls, tree, source, package_path)
        if class_dict:
            classes.append(class_dict)
            self.add_class_name(class_dict['class'])
    return classes
```
*Uses `javalang` to parse Java files and extract class/interface details.*

**3. Relationship Detection:**
```python
def validate_relationships(self) -> List[Dict]:
    valid_relationships = []
    for rel in self.relationships:
        if self._is_valid_relationship(rel):
            valid_relationships.append(rel)
    return valid_relationships
```
*Validates and deduplicates relationships between classes.*

**4. API Request Flow (Backend):**
```javascript
router.post('/analyze', asyncHandler(async (req, res) => {
  // Validate input, check cache, proxy to Python parser, return result
}));
```
*Handles analysis requests, applies caching and security checks.*

**5. Frontend Diagram Rendering (React):**
```javascript
export default function PlantUMLDiagram({ uml, format = 'svg', server }) {
  const encoded = plantumlEncoder.encode(uml);
  const src = `${server}/${format}/${encoded}`;
  return <img src={src} alt="UML Diagram" />;
}
```
*Renders UML diagrams in the frontend using PlantUML server.*

**6. Caching Strategy (Backend):**
```javascript
const cacheKey = (url, commit) => (commit ? `${url}@${commit}` : url);
// ...existing code...
if (memoryCache.has(cacheKey)) {
  return memoryCache.get(cacheKey);
}
```
*Implements cache key generation and lookup for backend caching.*
