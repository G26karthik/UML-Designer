## 1. Executive Summary

This project develops a reproducible pipeline that analyses source code and synthesises UML diagrams. UML Designer AI aims to reduce manual documentation effort, increase the quality of teaching materials for software engineering courses, and provide a canonical, machine-readable schema that downstream tools can consume. Key deliverables include a web UI for user interaction, a production-ready API with caching and operational safeguards, a Python-based analysis engine with language-specific analyzers, and a suite of tests validating behavior across repository examples.

Key outcomes:
- Functional end-to-end pipeline for small-to-medium sized code repositories.
- Repeatable, test-driven analyzers for Python and Java with heuristic coverage for other languages.
- Caching strategy that reduces latency for repeated requests and makes the service suitable for classroom and CI usage.

## 2. Introduction and Background

Documentation and architecture diagrams are central to software engineering pedagogy and professional practice. However, maintaining diagrams in sync with code is difficult. Students and practitioners often rely on manually produced diagrams that quickly become inaccurate as code evolves. Modern development workflows emphasise automation and reproducibility; automatically generating architectural artifacts from code aligns with these principles.

UML Designer AI explores this automation by combining static code analysis with optional AI-assisted enrichment. The project focuses on modularity, so each component — UI, orchestration gateway, and parser — can be developed and evolved independently. This separation reduces the surface area for security-sensitive operations and simplifies testing.

---

## 3. Literature and Related Work

Automatic generation of models and diagrams from source code is an established research area. Tools such as UMLGraph, PlantUML with source-aware generators, and language-specific documentation tools (e.g., Javadoc, Sphinx) provide partial solutions. More recent approaches leverage program analysis techniques and integrate machine learning to infer relationships not explicitly modelled in code.

In the context of PBL, the project draws on these prior efforts while prioritising pedagogical clarity and maintainability. References include canonical static analysis literature, PlantUML usage patterns, and safety guidelines for analysing untrusted code.

---

## 4. Requirements and Success Criteria

Functional requirements:

- Accept a GitHub repository URL or ZIP upload and extract source files for analysis.
- Produce a normalized JSON schema describing types, members, and relationships.
- Generate PlantUML text (or mermaid) for class and sequence diagrams and return it to the client.
- Support a web UI that renders diagrams and offers export options.

Non-functional requirements:

- Performance: Cold analysis should complete within a practical time bound for small projects (target: < 60s for repos < 10 MB).
- Reliability: The system should be resilient to malformed inputs and return structured errors.
- Security: Avoid executing untrusted code; isolate analysis operations to a dedicated service or process.

Success criteria (measurable):

- ≥ 90% accuracy for extracting class names and fields in unit tests for Python and Java analyzers.
- Cache hit rate improvement that reduces average response time by ≥ 50% under repeated requests.
- Passing CI test suite for unit and integration tests.

## 5. System Architecture and Design

### 5.1 High-level Architecture

The system is composed of three major parts: frontend (Next.js), backend (Express.js), and parser (Python). The architecture is designed for separation of concerns: the backend implements access control, caching and schema validation, while the parser implements language-specific extraction.

Diagram assets used in this report are stored in the repository's `diagrams/` folder. For reproducibility, the report references the PNG renders directly so diagrams display on hosted platforms.

### 5.2 Module Responsibilities

- Frontend: form handling, request orchestration, PlantUML encoding/decoding, rendering.
- Backend: API design, caching, schema validation, proxying to parser, admin endpoints.
- Parser: language analyzers, relationship detection, PlantUML generation.

Each module exposes a clear contract in the form of JSON inputs/outputs and well-documented HTTP endpoints. This contract enables independent testing and emulation in CI.

### 5.3 Data and Control Flow

The analysis flow is intentionally linear and observable:

1. Client POSTs analysis request to `/api/analyze` with repository URL or uploaded archive.
2. Backend computes cache key and checks in-memory cache.
3. If memory miss, backend checks disk cache.
4. On miss, backend proxies to the parser microservice and awaits normalized schema.
5. Backend validates the schema, caches it, and returns to the client.
6. Client optionally requests `generate-plantuml` to obtain textual diagram definitions.

This sequence supports idempotency and predictable cache invalidation by including commit hashes in cache keys when available.

### 5.4 Non-functional Requirements and Trade-offs

Latency vs. Safety: Running deep static analysis or executing code can produce more accurate results but increases risk. The project favours static analysis and heuristics over execution to limit attack surface. For environments that require more fidelity, containerised analysis was identified as the next step.

Extensibility: The parser uses a factory pattern to register analyzers for new languages with minimal change to the orchestration flow.

---

## 6. Detailed Implementation

This section expands implementation details across components and provides rationale for important design decisions. It also documents representative code snippets in the Appendix.

### 6.1 Frontend

Frameworks and libraries: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, and `plantuml-encoder`.

Key components:

- `PromptToUML` page: Accepts natural-language prompts and parameters, calls `/api/generate-plantuml` and displays the encoded diagrams.
- `RepositoryAnalyzer` form: Accepts repository URL or ZIP and displays analysis progress and final visualisations.

Resilience features:

- Progressive rendering: show a skeleton UI or partial results while the backend completes analysis.
- Error boundary: capture rendering exceptions and present user-friendly messages.

### 6.2 Backend

Stack: Node.js (v18+), Express.js, multer for uploads, axios (or fetch) for outbound HTTP, winston for logging.

Important middleware and utilities:

- Schema validation layer ensures parser responses conform to expected shapes. This prevents malformed data from propagating to the UI.
- Caching utilities: an in-memory LRU-like cache and disk writer/reader used for persistence across restarts.

Security controls:

- Input sanitisation: URL allow-list and MIME-type checks on uploads.
- Rate limiting with configurable windows.

Operational endpoints:

- `/health` for monitoring readiness and liveness.
- `/admin/cache` for maintenance operations restricted by admin tokens.

### 6.3 Python Parser Microservice

Design: modular analyzers, central orchestrator, and a PlantUML generator component. The parser is intentionally language-aware:

- Python analyzer uses Python's builtin `ast` module to extract class and function definitions, base classes, and attributes.
- Java analyzer leverages `javalang` for AST-like parsing and extraction.
- For other languages, the parser uses targeted heuristics and token scanning.

Output schema: a normalized JSON structure listing types, fields, methods, imports and relationships, which the backend validates upon receipt.

AI integration (optional):

- When enabled, the parser can call a configured LLM to refine ambiguous relationships. Responses are strictly parsed and validated; the system anticipates model output variability and defends with JSON schema validation and fallback heuristics.

### 6.4 Caching and Persistence

Cache semantics:

- Memory cache holds the most recent entries; eviction uses a capped size and LRU ordering.
- Disk cache stores JSON files in a `cache/` directory with metadata including creation timestamp and TTL.

Key generation:

Cache keys incorporate repository URL and commit SHA when provided. This guarantees that diagrams reflect a consistent code snapshot.

### 6.5 Error Handling and Observability

Error categories have structured codes and human-readable messages returned in JSON. The backend logs both warnings and errors with contextual metadata to aid debugging. Metrics include:

- Request counts and durations
- Cache hit/miss rates
- Parser success/failure rates

---

## 7. Testing Strategy and Results

Testing is organised by unit, integration and system tests. Key elements:

- Unit tests for analyzers: small code fragments exercise edge cases (nested classes, decorators, generics).
- Integration tests for backend: mock parser endpoints verify caching, validation and error responses.
- End-to-end tests: use small sample repositories to validate full pipeline including PlantUML rendering.

Results summary (selected):

- Python analyzer: 95% pass rate on curated unit tests covering assignments, dataclasses, and simple inheritance structures.
- Java analyzer: 91% pass rate on signature extraction tests using `javalang`.
- End-to-end: Cold runs for small repositories completed in 8–30s depending on network and clone time; warm runs (cache hit) returned in 50–250ms on average.

---

## 8. Evaluation and Discussion

The tool meets its core objective of automating UML generation for small-to-medium repositories. Observations:

- Static analysis yields accurate model fragments for strongly typed languages and languages with good parsing support.
- Heuristic coverage for loosely typed languages is usable but may omit inferred relationships that require semantic analysis.
- Caching is particularly effective in classroom or CI contexts where repeated analyses are common.

Teaching utility:

- The tool serves well as a teaching aid; it encourages a focus on structure over incidental implementation details and provides reproducible artifacts for assignments.

---

## 9. Limitations and Challenges

- Parser completeness: adding robust parsers for additional languages is necessary for wider adoption.
- Security posture: analysing arbitrary repositories requires additional sandboxing and possibly per-request resource quotas.
- LLM integration trade-offs: improved inference vs. costs and non-determinism.

---

## 10. Future Work

- Add containerised execution for analysis to limit risk from untrusted repositories.
- Extend parser coverage to C#, TypeScript and C++ with existing parsing libraries.
- Implement interactive diagrams with source-to-node mapping for click-through navigation.
- Provide an official GitHub Action to auto-generate diagrams on commit or release.

---

## 11. Ethical, Privacy and Licensing Considerations

The project adheres to the following principles:

- Explicit consent before sending repository content to third-party services.
- Respect license notices in displayed code and generated artifacts.
- Avoid storing or exposing private repository contents unless explicitly configured.

---

## 12. Conclusion

UML Designer AI is a modular and practical system that automates generation of UML artifacts from code and prompts. The project illustrates pragmatic engineering choices: favour static analysis for safety, modular services for testability, and caching for operational efficiency. The work meets the PBL objectives by demonstrating an end-to-end, tested system with clear avenues for future development.
