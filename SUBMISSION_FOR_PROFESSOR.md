Submitted by: Team 12
Date: 25 August 2025

Quick Start for Non-Technical Users
----------------------------------
1. Open the UML Designer AI web app.
2. Paste a GitHub repository link OR type a description of your system in plain English (e.g., "A library system with books, members, and loans. Members can borrow books.").
3. Instantly view and download a professional UML diagramâ€”no coding required!

Sample UML Diagram Outputs
-------------------------
Example 1: Library System
Prompt: "A library system with books, members, and loans. Members can borrow books."

Mermaid Output:
```
classDiagram
	class Book {
		title: String
		author: String
		isbn: String
		borrow()
		return()
	}
	class Member {
		name: String
		memberId: String
		borrowBook()
		returnBook()
	}
	class Loan {
		book: Book
		member: Member
		dueDate: Date
		renew()
		close()
	}
	Member ..> Book : uses
	Loan *-- Book : composition
	Loan *-- Member : composition
```

Example 2: E-Commerce Platform
Prompt: "An e-commerce platform with products, customers, orders, and payment processing."

Mermaid Output:
```
classDiagram
	class Product {
		name: String
		price: Float
		sku: String
		updateStock()
	}
	class Customer {
		name: String
		email: String
		placeOrder()
	}
	class Order {
		customer: Customer
		products: List[Product]
		total: Float
		addProduct()
		checkout()
	}
	class PaymentProcessor {
		provider: String
		processPayment()
	}
	Order o-- Product : aggregation
	Order --> Customer : association
	Order ..> PaymentProcessor : uses
```

Summary
-------
UML Designer is a compact full-stack project that analyzes source code from a repository and automatically generates UML class diagrams. It demonstrates multi-service integration (Next.js frontend, Express backend with caching, Python parser service) and practical concerns such as AST analysis, diagram generation, error handling, and developer UX.

Learning objectives (PBL-aligned)
---------------------------------
- Apply system decomposition and architecture design in a real full-stack project.
- Implement and test APIs and inter-service contracts.
- Work with language parsing (ASTs) and transform code structure into visual models.
- Improve software quality through iterative bug-fixing, tests, and documentation.

What the project does (short)
-----------------------------
1. Accepts a target GitHub repository and source files.
2. The Python parser analyzes source files (Java, Python, others) producing a normalized JSON model (classes, fields, methods, relationships).
3. The backend caches analysis results and exposes an API.
4. The frontend converts the JSON model to Mermaid UML syntax and renders diagrams in-browser; users can export SVG and copy source.

Architecture & key components
-----------------------------
- `frontend/`: Next.js + React UI, Mermaid rendering, user controls and tests.
- `backend/`: Express server, API endpoints, memory + disk caching layer, CORS and security middleware.
- `python-parser/`: Flask analysis service using language-specific parsers (e.g., `javalang` for Java, Python `ast`), heuristics, and optional AI enrichment.

Testing and verification
------------------------
- Unit tests exist for the Python parser and backend (see `python-parser/__tests__` and `backend/__tests__`).
- Manual smoke test: run parser (`python-parser/app.py`), start backend, open frontend and analyze a sample repo. Diagrams should render without Mermaid parse errors.
