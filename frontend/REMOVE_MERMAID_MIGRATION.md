# PlantUML-Only Frontend Migration Complete

## Status

All Mermaid.js code, dependencies, and documentation have been removed from the frontend. PlantUML is now the only supported diagram format for all diagram types (class, sequence, activity, state, usecase, component, communication, deployment).

## Files/Dirs Updated
- All Mermaid-related files and code have been removed. No Mermaid references remain in the frontend codebase, tests, or documentation.

## Next Steps
- Test all diagram types in the UI to confirm PlantUML is used everywhere
